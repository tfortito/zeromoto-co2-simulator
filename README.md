"Baseline emissions shall be calculated as the distance travelled (km) multiplied by an emission factor of 0.092 kg CO₂/km."

2.Diesel Car: 0.171 kg CO₂/km
Source: UK Government (DEFRA) 2023 Greenhouse Gas Conversion Factors
Average passenger diesel car emissions.

“Passenger car – diesel – average”

Emissions per km: ~171 g CO₂/km = 0.171 kg


3. Electric Scooter (Clean Energy): 0.000 kg CO₂/km
Assumes electricity from 100% renewables (e.g. solar/wind)
No emissions are counted when:
Charging from certified renewable energy
Used in CO₂ offset projects (e.g. Verra, Gold Standard)
Used as a standard for zero-emission transport projects.

4. Electric Scooter (Grid Avg): 0.020 kg CO₂/km
Based on:

Consumption: ~0.1 kWh/km

EU Grid Avg: ~200 g CO₂/kWh

Calculation:
0.1 kWh/km × 200 g CO₂/kWh = 20 g/km = 0.020 kg CO₂/km
